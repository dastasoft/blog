Let's make an easy and simple **circle progress bar** from an **animated SVG** in a **React component**. We only need a SVG, some hooks and a bunch of props to make it customizable.

The scope of this guide is to make a simple but customizable circle progress bar for starting at a very basic level of SVG animations.

If you want to skip the guide and check/fork the final result you can do it [here](https://github.com/dastasoft/react-ui-components/tree/master/src/components/CircleProgressBar) and in this [playground](https://bit.dev/dastag/ui-components/circle-progress-bar).

## Folder structure

I'll be following this folder structure:

```bash
-src
|-components
|--CircleProgressBar
|---index.js
|---CircleProgressBar.js
|---CircleProgressBarBase.js
```

- `index.js` will import/export `CircleProgressBar.js`, is a good practice and is easy when you want to import the component.
- `CircleProgressBar.js` will hold the **styled** version of `CircleProgessBarBase.js`. I'm using [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and I like to wrap the entire component in a separate file and working like in a normal CSS. We can discuss this part (or any other, but specially this one :D)
- `CircleProgressBarBase.js` will have all the magic, like any other regular React component.

## Basic Maths

Don't fear, this will be short and painless I promise!

```javascript
const circleConfig = {
  viewBox: '0 0 38 38',
  x: '19',
  y: '19',
  radio: '15.91549430918954',
}
```

We create this `circleConfig` object which have:

- `viewBox`: The current viewbox (min-x, min-y, width, height) for the SVG.
- `x` and `y` are the position of our SVG which is exactly the half (the middle) of the viewbox.
- `radio` is exactly a circle with a circunference of 100, why 100? Because is easy to understand to us in further calculations. Then, if you apply the formula for getting the radius (r = circunference / 2 Ï€) you'll get the magic number.

Later when we write the `circle` in html we'll use this calculations.

## Basic SVG

First of all, let's create the SVG, without any animations or props:

```javascript
<figure className={className}>
  <svg viewBox={circleConfig.viewBox}>
    <circle
      className="ring"
      cx={circleConfig.x}
      cy={circleConfig.y}
      r={circleConfig.radio}
      fill="transparent"
      stroke="gray"
    />

    <circle
      className="path"
      cx={circleConfig.x}
      cy={circleConfig.y}
      r={circleConfig.radio}
      fill="transparent"
      stroke="teal"
    />
  </svg>
</figure>
```

![circle-full](/assets/posts/content/circle-moved.jpg)

We're using the calculations we wrote above and have two elements inside of the SVG:

- `ring`: This circle will be used as the remaining content, if the main stays at 80%, this will be the 20% lasts. (For now is not visible btw)
- `path`: Will display the percentage/value, for now it's a 100% (all the circle).

Add `strokeDasharray="75 25"` to the second circle and check what happends.

The idea behind these numbers is `strokeDasharray` creates dashes in the stroke of a SVG shape. We're creating one stroke of **75** with color `teal` and other stroke of **25** transparent which allows to see the `gray` circle behind.

Because we're coming from a circle with circunference of 100, now the values for percentages are out of the box without any additional calculation :D

Now you can see both circles but... something is wrong, we want to start our progress bar at 12 o'clock, now it's starting at 3, for fix that, we need to add the property `strokeDashoffset`.

![circle-moved](/assets/posts/content/basic-circle.jpg)

We want to "move" the stroke a `25%` behind of his current position. For that we will use `strokeDashoffset="25"` in the second circle again.

Ok now is looking good!

## Display Text

We have a SVG which displays some kind of progress, let's add a number to display the exact number of progression and what mean that progression.

Inside of our current SVG:

```javascript
<figure>
  <svg viewBox={circleConfig.viewBox}>
    <circle
      className="ring"
      cx={circleConfig.x}
      cy={circleConfig.y}
      r={circleConfig.radio}
      fill="transparent"
      stroke="gray"
    />

    <circle
      className="path"
      cx={circleConfig.x}
      cy={circleConfig.y}
      r={circleConfig.radio}
      fill="transparent"
      stroke="teal"
      strokeDasharray="75 25"
      strokeDashoffset="25"
    />
    <g className="circle-label">
      <text x="50%" y="50%" className="circle-percentage">
        75%
      </text>
      <text x="50%" y="50%" className="circle-text">
        COMPLETE
      </text>
    </g>
  </svg>
</figure>
```

We need to add some styles, for that in `CircleProgressBar.js` add:

```javascript
import styled from 'styled-components'

import CircleProgressBarBase from './CircleProgressBarBase'

const CircleProgressBar = styled(CircleProgressBarBase)``

export default CircleProgressBar
```

Inside of the [template literal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) let's add the css:

```css
.circle-label {
  transform: translateY(0.25em);
}

.circle-percentage {
  font-size: 0.6em;
  line-height: 1;
  text-anchor: middle;
  transform: translateY(-0.25em);
}

.circle-text {
  font-size: 0.2em;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  text-anchor: middle;
  transform: translateY(0.7em);
}
```

At this point we have a regular SVG circle progress bar, let's a few tweaks to make it dynamic and valuable as a React component.

![circle-text](/assets/posts/content/circle-text.jpg)

## Basic Props

Let's implement this props:

- `trailStrokeColor` for the stroke color in the **ring circle**.
- `strokeColor` for the stroke color in the **path ring**.
- `percentage` for the total %.
- `innerText` for the meaning of percentage.

**Names of the props are totally up to you.**

The `CircleProgressBarBase.js` with props now:

```javascript
import React from 'react'

const INITIAL_OFFSET = 25
const circleConfig = {
  viewBox: '0 0 38 38',
  x: '19',
  y: '19',
  radio: '15.91549430918954',
}

const CircleProgressBarBase = ({
  className,
  trailStrokeColor,
  strokeColor,
  percentage,
  innerText,
}) => {
  return (
    <figure className={className}>
      <svg viewBox={circleConfig.viewBox}>
        <circle
          className="ring"
          cx={circleConfig.x}
          cy={circleConfig.y}
          r={circleConfig.radio}
          fill="transparent"
          stroke={trailStrokeColor}
        />

        <circle
          className="path"
          cx={circleConfig.x}
          cy={circleConfig.y}
          r={circleConfig.radio}
          fill="transparent"
          stroke={strokeColor}
          strokeDasharray={`${percentage} ${100 - percentage}`}
          strokeDashoffset={INITIAL_OFFSET}
        />
        <g className="circle-label">
          <text x="50%" y="50%" className="circle-percentage">
            {percentage}%
          </text>
          <text x="50%" y="50%" className="circle-text">
            {innerText}
          </text>
        </g>
      </svg>
    </figure>
  )
}

export default CircleProgressBarBase
```

Worth to mention:

- `className` is needed because the styled-prop will pass the CSS classes with this.
- `strokeDasharray={`${percentage} ${100 - percentage}`}` is the calculation we hardcoded before as `75 25`.

Now import in a different js file the component with props and check the result:

```javascript
import React from 'react'

import CircleProgressBar from './components/CircleProgressBar'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <CircleProgressBar
      trailStrokeColor="gray"
      strokeColor="teal"
      percentage={75}
      innerText="complete"
    />
  )
}

render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

![circle-text](/assets/posts/content/circle-text.jpg)

## Number Animation

Let's add an animation in the number, from 0 to the value passed into `percentage`.

The strategy will be, use the state, because a React component only re-render if his state or props changes. We will need `useState` and `useEffect` hooks from `react`.

```javascript
const [progressBar, setProgressBar] = useState(0)
```

`progressBar` now is the state of the component, starting at 0, and can be "modified" through `setProgressBar`.

```javascript
const updatePercentage = () => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    setProgressBar(progressBar + 1)
  }, 5)
}

useEffect(() => {
  if (percentage > 0) updatePercentage()
}, [percentage])

useEffect(() => {
  if (progressBar < percentage) updatePercentage()
}, [progressBar])
```

The first `useEffect` will be triggered when `percentage` prop is changed. This is needed instead of a simple `[]`, that will be on mount, because if you use this component in combination with a backend service you first will pass `percentage={0}` and later in async mode, a value.

The second `useEffect` will be triggered when the `progessBar` is modified.

Both effects will execute `updatePercentage`, that function executes a `timeout` which will execute the inner function in 5 milliseconds.

Now your `CircleProgressBar` will "fill" the number from 0 to the value passed through `percentage` prop at a constant time of 5ms, seems an animation but in fact it's a simple re-render.

**Try to use different values than 5ms and check the behaviour.**

## Stroke Animation

Let's enter to the real deal, the number is already "animated" now it's time to the stroke.

The strategy will be the same than before, we can apply a good looking CSS animation but... we already have one value which indicates the percentage and would be nice if the stroke and the number dance together.

Use `progressBar` for the calculations in `strokeDashArray`:

```javascript
// strokeDasharray={`${percentage} ${100 - percentage}`}
strokeDasharray={`${progressBar} ${100 - progressBar}`}
```

Now the stroke will grow with every re-render at the same speed than the number. I guess we can't really call this an animation after all.

## Extra Stuff

In the [Github repo](https://github.com/dastasoft/react-ui-components/tree/master/src/components/CircleProgressBar) you can find extra stuff made in the component such as:

- A prop `speed` to choose which speed want to use in the "animation".
- A legend to display with the Circle.
- The `ring` can be spaced or solid like in the example.
- **Prop type validation** and **default prop values**.

## Conclusion

We learn the creation of a simple SVG shape with "animations" in a isolated React component.

The component can be extended in multiple ways, for example removing the local state and passing the `progressBar` from outside as a prop to display a real progression in the comunicacion with a service using **RxJS**.

The repo is open for any improvement or customization you may think would be cool and is available for use with:

```bash
yarn add @bit/dastag.ui-components.circle-progress-bar
```

Enjoy!
